# my-tailwind-practice
This repository serves as a timeline of my journey learning Tailwind CSS. It includes various projects and examples that showcase how my understanding of utility-first CSS has evolved over time. From basic layout experiments to more complex, responsive designs, each commit reflects a new concept or technique I've explored. The goal of this repo is to track my progress, demonstrate practical applications of Tailwind, and provide a reference for future projects as I continue to refine my skills
